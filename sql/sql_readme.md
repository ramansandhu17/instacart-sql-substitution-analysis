# SQL Analysis â€“ Instacart Substitution Analytics

This folder contains all SQL queries developed for the **Instacart Substitution Analytics Project**.  
The goal of this project is to analyze the patterns and impact of product substitutions during order fulfillment and recommend improvements to reduce customer churn and operational inefficiencies.

All queries are written in standard SQL and were executed in DataGrip using the following datasets:
- `orders.csv`
- `order_products__prior.csv`
- `products.csv`
- `departments.csv`
- `aisles.csv`
- Simulated `substitutions.csv` (based on 5â€“10% of sampled orders)

## Techniques Used

This SQL analysis includes:

- Multiple table JOINs (inner, left)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions (`LAG`, `ROW_NUMBER`)
- CASE logic and conditional aggregation
- Subqueries and grouping
- Data export for Tableau dashboarding
